# PDF Folder

This folder is watched by the RAG system for new PDF files.

## How to use:

1. Place your PDF files in this folder
2. The system will automatically detect and process them
3. Documents will be chunked and embedded into ChromaDB
4. You can then query the documents through the /api/chat endpoint

## Example PDFs you can add:

- SEBI regulations documents
- Financial market guidelines
- Investment advisory documents
- Any other relevant PDF documents

The system will process them automatically and make them searchable through the chatbot interface.
